# Internationalization


## Translating Flashlight.app

`Flashlight.app` is currently translated into English, German, Spanish, Dutch, Chinese, French, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, Turkish and Korean. If you're fluent in another language, it'd be awesome if you could translate it.

Flashlight is translated via the usual OS X app localization methods. You'll want to copy [en.lproj](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/tree/master/FlashlightApp/EasySIMBL/en.lproj), replace `en` with your language code, and translate the strings in `Localizable.strings`. See [the German translation](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/blob/master/FlashlightApp/EasySIMBL/de.lproj/Localizable.strings) for an example.

## Translating your plugin

Different parts of your plugin should be internationalized in different ways:

**Info.json** keys like `displayName` and `description` should be localized by adding new keys with names like `displayName_zh` and `description_zh`, where `zh` is replaced with your language code. Do _not_ translate `categories`.

**Examples.txt** can be translated by adding new `examples_zh.txt` files. Make sure to translate the commands and sample text, but not the field names. (e.g. `天气在 ~place(上海)`)

**Strings** that are returned by Python can be translated any way you'd like. The easiest way is probably to use Flashlight's `i18n` module. The strings you're going to display to the user, put them in a file called `strings_zh.json`, using the English phrases as keys and the translated phrases as values, and then call `i18n.localstr("english text")` to get a local string. _Do not_ create a `strings_en.json` — just use English strings as keys.

**Other files** like HTML can be localized by copying them with names like `myHTML_zh.html`, then getting the _appropriate localized file's path_ by calling `i18n.find_localized_path("myHTML.html")`. Don't create `myHTML_en.html` — just use `myHTML.html` for the English resource.

_A good example of a localized plugin is the [timezone plugin](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/tree/master/PluginDirectories/1/timezone.bundle)._
